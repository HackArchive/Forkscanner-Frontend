### About Forkscanner 
[Forkscanner](https://github.com/twilight-project/forkscanner/) is a sophisticated tool designed to actively monitor the Bitcoin blockchain in real-time, providing users with valuable insights into the state of the network. By continuously scanning the blockchain, Forkscanner is able to keep track of various critical aspects of the network's operations, including chain forks, double-spent transactions, replace-by-fee transactions, inflation checks, miner rewards, block templates, fee calculation, and soft forks.

With its comprehensive monitoring capabilities, Forkscanner provides users with unparalleled visibility into the inner workings of the Bitcoin network, allowing them to make informed decisions about their transactions and investments. Its robust feature set and real-time monitoring capabilities make it an essential tool for anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency.

# About This Project
This project involves the implementation of a frontend for Forkscanner, as part of the MIT Bitcoin Hackathon challenge. The frontend leverages backend RPC calls and socket connections to subscribe to real-time events on the network and obtain relevant information, thereby enhancing the functionality of the backend and simplifying user interaction with the tool. Through this implementation, the frontend extends the capabilities of Forkscanner and makes it easier for users to access and use its features.
